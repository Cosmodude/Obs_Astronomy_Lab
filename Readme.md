# Data
    I don't post calibration files and images because they are too heavy.

    Images can be viewed via ds9 app:

## Preprocessing Done 
    Later only 06-diffphot.ipynb.py file is necessary for analysis,
    others are optional

    Get stars using DAO finder and Query
    Drop nearby ones first, then match 
    get reference stars from these
    then photometry for them
