## Preprocessing 
Using the scripts provided by the manual  (00-preprocessing.ipynb)  link: 

I've callibrated the images:
    - updated the script with regard to my folder structure and fixed the code to be compatible with my OS
    - raw images + callibration files were used
    - Changed between: B,I,R,V filters manually and run script for each to callibrate them separately
    - Got a new folder with calibrated images

Created my own scripts (helpful_scripts.py) including useful functions for alligning images for each filter
